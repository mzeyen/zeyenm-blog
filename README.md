# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Running application using docker:

    * pull image from docker hub: **docker pull mzeyen/zeyenm-blog:latest**
    * start container: **docker run -it -p 80:3000 mzeyen/zeyenm-blog:latest**
    * start container with mounted volume: **docker run -it -p 80:3000 -v {local folder path}:/app mzeyen/zeyenm-blog:latest**
